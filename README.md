# Organized Output Directory
With "Organized Output Directory" you can create order in your output directory.
The script automatically creates subdirectories for each game in the output directory.
To do this, it searches for Window Capture or Game Capture sources in the current scene.
The top active source is then used to determine the name of the subdirectory from the window title or the process name.
